        <div class='modal-description'>
          An energetic and creative person, competent graphic and web designer, and proficient technical support provider with an eye for detail. A hard working proactive developer focused on high quality solutions proven to engage users in a competitive market. Successfully works with technical and non-technical professionals. Passionate for continuous learning and improving. Proven leader with positive results, managing multiple projects to deliver solutions on time consistently, with increased customer engagement.
          <br>
          While experts in their fields can say they wrote the book on a specific topic, I can say that I have instead written the test for web and front end developers. Amongst my freelance web design responsibilities, I received functional requirements to develop a four tier testing scenario with answer key including various potential solutions to verify qualifications and knowledge of potential web developer candidates through Proxor.
          <br>
          Over the last several years I have been working as a web developer for EWTN (Eternal Word Television Network). I have been actively using CSS, HTML, Ruby on Rails, Wordpress, and JavaScript across a number of sites to match the company’s look and feel while providing a more positive user experience.
          <br>
          I am always ready to learn new techniques and use the latest technology to help others have a better online experience. I am a team player capable of working independently to meet specific deadlines while multitasking.
